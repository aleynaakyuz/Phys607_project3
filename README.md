# Phys607_project3

This project uses the Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
to estimate two parameters from simulated gravitational wave
data with Gaussian noise from binary black hole mergers.

To run the code, clone this repo using the link: https://github.com/aleynaakyuz/Phys607_project3.git
then run: pip install estimator
